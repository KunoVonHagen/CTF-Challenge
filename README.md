![Changing cgroup to v1](images/setup/change_cgroup_to_v1.PNG)

After running the script, reboot your system to apply the changes.

![Rebooting System](images/setup/reboot.PNG)

### Step 4: Setup the Challenge
Once you've rebooted and returned to your host system, run the setup script and wait for the challenge to start.

![Running Challenge Setup](images/setup/challenge_setup.PNG)

### Step 5: Configure the Attacking System
After the setup succeeds, you'll be prompted to add your host system's IP with the domain `ctf-challenge.edu` to the `/etc/hosts` file on the system you plan to attack from.

To find an accessible IP address, run `ifconfig` on your host system before switching to the attacking system.

![Running ifconfig](images/setup/ifconfig.PNG)


## Beginning the Challenge

### Step 1: Explore the Website
To start the challenge, we should investigate what lies behind the `ctf-challenge.edu` domain.

Navigating to the domain in your preferred browser brings up a simple blog where you can admire some cats.

![Opening the Website](images/frontend/open_website.PNG)

### Step 2: Test for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
As you scroll down, you'll find a comment section. Here, try injecting a simple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payload.

![Testing XSS](images/frontend/test_XSS.PNG)

It turns out that the XSS payload works!

![XSS Success](images/frontend/XSS_success.PNG)

### Step 3: Investigate Further
Now, we need to find a way to exploit this XSS vulnerability to access the first machine. Clicking on the "Monitoring Service" text in the footer takes you to a page that monitors the status of the website. This suggests there may be another service that loads the site and uses elevated privileges to update the status page.

Next, let's inspect the cookies to gather more clues.

![Inspecting Cookies](images/frontend/inspect_cookies.PNG)

We found a session cookie. If we're lucky, this cookie could be used to update the status page, which likely requires elevated privileges. We can use Burp Suite to inspect how comments are sent to the server. With some luck, we could use the XSS vulnerability to make the monitoring service send its session cookie as a comment so that we can capture it.

![Analyzing Comment Request in Burp Suite](images/frontend/burpsuite_analyse_comment_request.PNG)

### Step 4: Crafting the Payload
Using the information gathered, let's craft a payload (`XSS_payload.txt`) to try and steal the session cookie from the monitoring service by posting it as a comment. After some waiting and refreshing, we should see not only our own session cookie but also another one appear in the comments. It seems our payload was successful!

![Stealing Cookies Success](images/frontend/stealing_cookies_success.PNG)

### Step 5: Hijack the Monitoring Service Session
Replace your own cookie with the stolen session cookie and refresh the site. This action should change the header.

![Monitoring Login Header](images/frontend/monitoring_login_header.PNG)

It looks like we've successfully hijacked the monitoring service session! The username now shows as 'monitoring', and a button for an admin panel appears. Clicking on it will lead you to the admin panel.

![Admin Panel](images/frontend/admin_panel.PNG)

### Step 6: Upload a Reverse Shell
One of the options, the "Add Page" section, looks particularly promising. Here, let's try uploading a PHP Reverse Shell (e.g., `php-reverse-shell.php` from [Pentestmonkey's repository](https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell)) to establish a shell connection and access the first machine.

![Connecting Reverse Shell](images/frontend/connect_reverse_shell.PNG)

### Step 7: Capture the First Flag
Success! We've established a shell to the first machine. Now, we can run the `get_flag` binary to capture our first flag.

![First Flag Captured](images/frontend/first_flag.PNG)


## Pivoting to the Backend

### Step 1: Identify New Targets
After gaining access to the first machine, we should look for additional targets. By reading the `/etc/hosts` file, we discover two new targets: `backend` and `monitoring`.

![Reading /etc/hosts](images/backend_first_flag/etc_hosts_frontend.PNG)

### Step 2: Route Traffic to New Targets
To continue our attack, we'll use the `autoroute` module in Metasploit to route traffic to these new targets through our existing session.

![Using Autoroute Module](images/backend_first_flag/autoroute_frontend.PNG)

### Step 3: Set Up a Proxy for External Access
Next, we'll set up a proxy in Metasploit to allow external programs to access these routes.

![Setting Up a SOCKS Proxy](images/backend_first_flag/setup_socks_proxy_frontend.PNG)

To utilize this proxy, we need to configure it in our `proxychains4.conf`.

![Editing proxychains4.conf](images/backend_first_flag/edit_proxychains_conf.PNG)

### Step 4: Scan for Open Ports
With the proxy set up, we can use `nmap` to scan the ports of our new targets.

![Scanning Ports with nmap](images/backend_first_flag/nmap_frontend.PNG)

### Step 5: Exploit OpenSSH Vulnerability
The scan of the `backend` server reveals that OpenSSH 7.7 is running, which is vulnerable to a username enumeration exploit. We can verify this using `searchsploit`.

![Using searchsploit for OpenSSH 7.7](images/backend_first_flag/searchsploit_frontend.PNG)

Although there is a Metasploit module for this vulnerability, it tends to crash frequently. Instead, we can use the exploit script provided by `searchsploit`. Note that the first two scripts are written for an older version of the `paramiko` library, so we need to install this library for Python 2 if it's not already installed. 

The exploit is originally designed to test a single username, but we can use the `openssh_exploit.sh` script to iterate through all the usernames in the `unix_users.txt` (can also be found [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/data/wordlists/unix_users.txt)) wordlist provided with the challenge. This script assumes the exploit is in the standard location on Kali Linux, but it can be adapted if you need to download the exploit first (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/45939).

![Running OpenSSH Exploit Script](images/backend_first_flag/openssh_exploit.PNG)

After a long wait (due to the lengthy SSH timeout), we finally get a list of valid usernames. Now, we need to find a password.

### Step 6: Analyze the Application Code
Next, let's inspect the `main.py` file for clues. We find that the server establishes a connection to the same `backend` server on the other open port we discovered.

![Finding DB Connection in main.py](images/backend_first_flag/frontend_main_find_db_connection.PNG)

Looking further into the code, we find details on how the database connection is established.

![DB Connection Details in main.py](images/backend_first_flag/frontend_main_find_db_connection_details.PNG)

Further down, we observe some peculiar input sanitization occurring on the frontendâ€”a sign that the backend might not be sanitizing input properly.

![Input Sanitization in main.py](images/backend_first_flag/frontend_main_sanitization.PNG)

### Step 7: Perform SQL Injection
With this knowledge, we should look for a function that accepts input and returns output from the database. The `get_username_from_session` function, which uses the `get-username-from-session` action, seems like a good candidate.

![Finding Vulnerable Function in main.py](images/backend_first_flag/frontend_main_find_vulnerable_function.PNG)

Through some trial and error, we can construct the `sql_injection_exploit.py` script. This script allows us to inspect the layout of the database, then the `users` table, and finally, retrieve the interesting `admin` username and its corresponding password hash.

![SQL Injection Results](images/backend_first_flag/sqli_results.PNG)

### Step 8: Crack the Password Hash
The retrieved hash can be cracked using tools like `john`, with the provided `unix_passwords.txt` (can also be found [here](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt)) wordlist.

![Cracking the Hash](images/backend_first_flag/crack_hash.PNG)

### Step 9: Access the Backend Server
We can then use the cracked credentials to connect to the `backend` server via SSH.

![Connecting to Backend Server via SSH](images/backend_first_flag/backend_ssh_connection.PNG)

### Step 10: Capture the Second Flag
We have successfully accessed the `backend` server! Now, let's generate the second flag and move on to the next part of the challenge.

![Generating the Second Flag](images/backend_first_flag/backend_first_flag.PNG)


## Gaining Root Access on the Backend Server

### Step 1: Check Sudo Version
To proceed further in the challenge, our goal is to gain root access on the `backend` server. First, let's check the version of `sudo` to identify a potential attack vector.

![Checking Sudo Version](images/backend_second_flag/backend_sudo_version.PNG)

### Step 2: Exploit CVE-2019-14287
The `sudo` version on this server is vulnerable to privilege escalation via CVE-2019-14287 (you can read more about it [here](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-14287)). Additionally, the output of `sudo -l` confirms that the sudo configuration on this system meets the criteria necessary to exploit this vulnerability.

![Exploiting CVE-2019-14287](images/backend_second_flag/backend_sudo_exploit.PNG)

### Step 3: Obtain the Root Flag
With the root shell obtained, we can now retrieve the third flag and move on to the next target.

![Retrieving the Third Flag](images/backend_second_flag/backend_second_flag.PNG)


## Gaining Access to the Monitoring Server

### Step 1: Investigate Clues from devlog.txt
Exploring the `devlog.txt` file provides a clue that the `coolsh_server.py` file found in the `/root` directory might also be running on the `monitoring` server with similar settings.

![Inspecting devlog.txt](images/monitoring_first_flag/backend_root_devlog.PNG)

### Step 2: Inspect the Server and Client Files
Next, let's inspect the server and client files to understand what we're dealing with.

![Inspecting coolsh_server.py](images/monitoring_first_flag/backend_cat_coolsh.PNG)

It appears that the admin has created a custom version of SSH and left their public key to facilitate easy connections. However, the modulus used in the public key is unusually small. This presents an opportunity to factorize it and calculate the private key using the `crack_rsa_mod.py` script.

![Cracking RSA Modulus](images/monitoring_first_flag/backend_crack_rsa_modulus.PNG)

### Step 3: Analyze `coolsh.py` for Connection Details
With the private key in hand, we should inspect the `coolsh.py` library to understand how we can connect using public key authentication.

![Inspecting coolsh.py](images/monitoring_first_flag/backend_coolsh_library.PNG)

### Step 4: Connect to the Monitoring Server
Using the information gathered, we can construct the `coolsh_connection.py` script to connect using the private key we just factorized.

![Connecting with coolsh_connection.py](images/monitoring_first_flag/monitoring_coolsh_connection.PNG)

### Step 5: Obtain the Fourth Flag
We're in! Now, we can generate the fourth flag and prepare to switch to the `monitoring` server for further exploration.

![Obtaining the Fourth Flag](images/monitoring_first_flag/monitoring_first_flag.PNG)


## Gain Root Access on the Monitoring Server

### Step 1: Investigate the get_flags.c Source Code
Upon retrieving the fourth flag, we notice a difference compared to other scripts used to obtain flags. To explore this further, we should investigate the `get_flags.c` source code, which is still conveniently present in the directory.

![Inspecting get_flags.c Main Function](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_get_flags_main.PNG)

### Step 2: Analyze the Vulnerability in get_email Function
Inspecting the `main` function reveals that the script temporarily elevates to root privileges to read secrets from the `/root` directory. This suggests a potential opportunity for exploitation. By further examining the `get_email` function, we observe that it writes the email of the user from a dynamic char pointer to a fixed-length buffer and uses the `gets` function, which is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.

![Inspecting get_email Function](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_get_flags_get_email.PNG)

### Step 3: Confirm the Buffer Address
To exploit this buffer overflow and get a shell, we need the address of the buffer. Running the `get_flags` binary multiple times (from the same shell) shows that the buffer's address remains the same. This consistency allows us to craft an exploit.

![Buffer Address Consistency](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_buffer_same_address.PNG)

### Step 4: Craft and Execute the Exploit
With the buffer address known, we can craft the exploit in `buffer_overflow_exploit.py` after generating the necessary shellcode using Metasploit.

![Generating Shellcode with Metasploit](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_buffer_overflow_generate_shellcode.PNG)

Now, we need to execute our exploit while keeping a second shell open with `netcat` running on the same system to receive the connection if the exploit succeeds.

![Running Buffer Overflow Exploit](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_buffer_overflow_exploit.PNG)
![Receiving Shell via Netcat](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_buffer_overflow_recieve_shell.PNG)

### Step 5: Elevate to Full Root Shell
Since the `get_flags` binary only changed our `uid`, we need to run `su` once more to gain a "full" root shell.

![Elevating to Full Root Shell](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_elevate_root_shell.PNG)

### Step 6: Obtain the Fifth Flag
With full root access on the `monitoring` server, we can now run the `get_flags` binary once more to retrieve the fifth flag.

![Retrieving the Fifth Flag](images/monitoring_second_flag/monitoring_get_second_flag.PNG)


## Breaking out of the Docker Container

### Step 1: Check devlog.txt for Clues
Since we have root access on what appears to be the last machine but are stuck finding the sixth flag, we should revisit the `devlog.txt` for additional clues.

![Inspecting devlog.txt](images/monitoring_host/monitoring_devlog.PNG)

The clue reveals that we are inside a Docker container running Docker version 18.09.1, which is vulnerable to CVE-2019-5736 ([CVE-2019-5736 Details](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-5736)). Additionally, we know that `docker exec` is used repeatedly to call the `check_monitoring.sh` script, which is quite useful for our next steps.

### Step 2: Prepare the Exploit
We need to upload and prepare the files from the `runc` directory of this repository, which relies largely on the PoC provided by Twistlock ([Twistlock PoC](https://github.com/twistlock/RunC-CVE-2019-5736/tree/master/exec_POC)).

![Preparing runc Exploit Files](images/monitoring_host/monitoring_host_prepare_runc_exploit.PNG)

### Step 3: Execute the Exploit
Start the exploit by running the `replace.sh` script.

![Running runc Exploit](images/monitoring_host/monitoring_host_runc_exploit_success.PNG)

After some waiting and several attempts (due to the `runc` binary being removed before obtaining a writable file descriptor), the exploit should succeed.

### Step 4: Retrieve the Final Flag
Now that the exploit has been executed successfully, navigate to the `/root` directory and run `get_flag` to retrieve the sixth and final flag.

![Getting the Sixth Flag](images/monitoring_host/monitoring_host_get_flag.PNG)
